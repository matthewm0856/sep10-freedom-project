# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* What if you could magically save plants?

## Product
* https://matthewm0856.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/

## Process
* I made up a few inventions that could help preserve plants and life further. The inventions I made could regulate plants even during climate change. All the information is on my website on the next page

## Conclusion
* In summary, this project gave me an Idea to save our environment. If it wasn’t for this project, I wouldn’t have any ideas or innovations for the future. I feel like this project could boost my grade up since my grades in this class are slim and this project was easy and I feel like this project could boost my grade up. Now, I feel like I could do something for the world.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.

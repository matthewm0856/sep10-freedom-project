# Entry 5: My Tool
##### 4/21/25

### My tool:
The tool I am using for my project is aframe. What I learned about aframe is that it can be used to build 3D models and to build virtual worlds. Aframe has a variety of shapes, models and covers. With aframe, you can make fiction that could come to life in 360. Aframe also has cool models you can use. Ichose aframe becuase my project is about environmental government and I'm using aframe to build a model or device that can regulate the environment.

### How I learned my tool
Sadly, I don't know how to make anything yet but I played with some shapes in the meantime. The hard thing was how to moe the shapes. If I put it up or down, I can't tell how down or up it goes. It was aso hard to move around the model since it's not like the controls you see in a videogame. I even could't see where my shape was going. Even if I don't how to model yet, I'm still learning and I'm getting used to some of the basics.

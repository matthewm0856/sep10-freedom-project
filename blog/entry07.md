# Entry 7: Takeaways from my project

## Takeaways:
Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the expo but I have a lot to take from my presentation. While I was presenting, I was a little shy but knowing that this is my first time sharing my Ideas to the whole class, I felt more confident to share my Ideas. My presentation went well, sharing all the stuff I plan for the future and I explained using my tool, my website, my process and how I am going to find new Ideas.

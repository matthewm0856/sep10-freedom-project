# Entry 6: MVP
##### 5/5/2025

## My MVP
For my MVP, I have to make a website based on the topic I chose for my freedom project and for my website, I'm going to talk about my innovations for the future and how I could have an impact on the future. This is my final part for the freedom project and I have to present this to my class and to present, I have to make slides to introduce my project and I have to use platforms like A-frame, CSS animation etc. and I chose a-frame. I even have to use this to show my product and to give people a little taste for my innovations

## What is MVP?
MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is an early version of a website that's open for testing my real users. MVP's only include the essential features needed for a product and the website is not fully developed but open for people to use or navigate.
That means that my website is done but not completely done. I don't have an actual link of my website but I have the github link for it.

## What are innovations?
Innovations are products and Ideas set for the future. You're introducing ideas that could be in good use and It's an idea before actually working on it. For example, innovations are 3d models or drawings of your idea or product and
it's best to create an innovation first so you can have ideas in the future when you work on your product.

## Challenges
One challenge I will have to face is how an I going to use this tool. A-frame will take a while to learn and for beginners, don't expect it to be perfect but do your best and another challenge I will face is making AI generated images into 3d models since thy're detailed and I can't put that much for now so I will have to create the basic details first before adding newer ones.

## Takeaways
This is the first time I will be presenting a website to my whole class and I'm exited to share my innovations for the first time. Next time when it comes to innovations, I shouldn't have used a-frame since it's hard but I feel like I could be easier since i just have to make shapes and move them but I can still do my best to share my models.
